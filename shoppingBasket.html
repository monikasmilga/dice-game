<p id="text1">As of 2017, text messages are used by youth and adults for personal, family and social purposes and in
    business, government and non-governmental organizations for communication between colleagues. As with emailing, in
    the 2010s, the sending of short informal messages has become an accepted part of many cultures. This makes texting
    a quick and easy way to communicate with friends and colleagues, including in contexts where a phone call would be
    impolite or inappropriate (e.g., calling very late at night or when one knows the other person is busy with family
    or work activities).</p>
